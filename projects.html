                    <div class="p1about">In this project, I created a responsive portfolio website by using the technologies such as 
                        HTML5, CSS, JavaScript and deployed it on GitHub. This portfolio website contains information such as 
                        personal details, education qualification, projects and skills.

                    <div class="p2about">The main aim of this project is to enhance the aesthetic value of vehicle, which basically 
                        means enhancing the appereance. Me and my teammates made a side panel of vehicle Yamaha RX 135 using epoxy 
                        resin in which we had installed LED's in it which could change the colour of the entire panel according to the 
                        need of the driver. This project helps in reducing the time and cost required for paintintg the vehicle and 
                        change the colour of the vehicle as required within seconds. This project even helped me secure 3rd place in 
                        college exhibiton and got selected for VTU financil assistance.

                    <div class="p3about">The main aim of this project is to reduce the parking space required to park the car. Me and
                        my teammates made this project in which we can park 6 cars in the space of 2 cars using rotary car parking system.
                        In this system there are 6 slots for parking 6 vehicle and once one of the slot is occupied the occupied slot
                        rotates and make access for the empty slot in which another vehcile can be parked. In this system we have even 
                        used RFID card and scanner. The particular card is attached to each one of the slots and as the driver enter the 
                        card number in which he/she has parked the car the slot rotates and the driver can take out his vehicle from the 
                        parking.

                    <div class="p4title">Four Wheel Steering Mechanism</div>
                    <div class="p4about">The main aim of this project is to rotate all the four wheels of the vehicle which is also
                        basically known as zero turning radius. This project helps the driver to park the vehcile or turn the vehicle in 
                        between the obstacles. The driver can also move the car in vertical/horizontal/diagonal direction without
                        actually turning the vehicle but just with the help of four wheel steering system.
